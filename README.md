# Welcome to Ellie's notes!

Hi! My name is Ellie, and I'm a student at UIUC studying Information Science, and minoring in Game Design! I'm a senior now, and I wanted to document my notes to keep track of all of my learnings, specifically in my Game Design classes. I'm also hoping that these notes will be helpful to other students, or anyone who wants to learn more about the world of game design here at UIUC. 

Special shout out to all of my cool professors who's classes I'm eternally grateful for! Every Class you checkout will have the professor and a bit about them. 

### Classes
Currently, I am publishing the Spring 2024 Courses I am taking relating to Game Design. In the future, I'll be posting some of my older classes from previous semesters. These are all UI classes alongside more game design content ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰. 

Thanks for checking the site out! If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me on Twitter or Discord. All of my stuff is also just open source on **[GitHub](https://github.com/exrlla)**.
